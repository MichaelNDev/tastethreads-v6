# TasteThreads

## Description

TasteThreads was created to answer an important question I most commonly received from customers and patrons during my time in the food service industry, "What dish do you recommend?"

TasteThreads is a new app designed for crowdsourcing the best food or dish restuarants are known for(ideally the lesser known and niche restaurants). With the crowdsource effort, new users can come in and see what food is popular and may want to try while hearing about others' experience with a particular dish!
